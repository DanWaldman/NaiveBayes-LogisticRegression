# Context
This Notebook explains deeply how Linear classifiers are performed, and it compares Logistic Regression to Naive Bayes.
This was a project in the course "Machine Learning" which I took in my second semester of my second year in my Computer Science degree in Reichman University.
In this project I implemented Expectation Maximization and used it with my implemetation of Naive Bayes and I compared it to my implementation of Logistic Regression .
All I used to create my code was Pandas, numpy, and matplotlib for visualizasion. 
All the calaculations and steps are explained.

Hope You Enjoy!
